Did you ever buy a 600$ gym membership, only to go twice? This means it cost you 300$ each time you went to the gym! Make it worth your while by tracking your cost-per-use with this simple website. 

(Used to be called "Too Damn High" after the "The rent is too damn high" meme guy, because I met him in Bed-Stuy the week I started this project, but I decided to switch to a more polite title once I wanted to show the site to people.)

Written in Python and JS, will probably turn it into a Firefox app at some point.
